# Dietet

This application is a project for my programming subject in my first year of degree.

## Disclaimer
As I said, this was during my first year of university, which was also my first 4 months into programming, as you may expect this is not close to being an elegant and clean code, but reviewing and trying to understand nearly 4000 lines of code years laters its lot of time consuming and worthless. However, the few functionalities the application has, work more or less fine and it may be usefull for someone.
## App

The app has a database with few aliments that I added on my own. The functionalities are simple, there is a calory and macros calculator, a user tab for giving nutritional recommendations(unreliable) and a diet creator.
